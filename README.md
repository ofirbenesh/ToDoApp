# ToDoApp

**ToDoApp** is a full-stack task management app with real-time collaboration. It supports creating, editing, deleting, and completing tasks across multiple clients using Angular (frontend), Node.js with Express (backend), and MongoDB (database). All task changes are synchronized in real time, and edit-locking ensures no two users can edit the same task simultaneously.

## üöÄ Features

- Add, edit, delete tasks
- Mark tasks as completed/incomplete
- Real-time updates using WebSockets (Socket.IO)
- Edit-lock mechanism per task (only one client can edit at a time)
- Responsive UI using Angular Material
- User authentication with JWT (bonus)

## üõ† Technologies Used

### Frontend
- **Angular 17**
- **RxJS** for reactive data streams
- **Angular Material** for UI components
- **Socket.IO Client** for real-time updates
- **SCSS** styling
- **FormsModule** and **ReactiveFormsModule**

### Backend
- **Node.js** with **Express.js**
- **MongoDB** with **Mongoose**
- **Socket.IO Server**
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for authentication
- **Dotenv** for environment configuration

## üìê Design Patterns

- **Repository Pattern** (Backend): Encapsulates all DB interactions in a dedicated layer
- **Singleton Pattern** (Backend): Manages a single shared Socket.IO instance
- **Service Pattern** (Frontend): Handles API communication and shared state via Angular services
- **Reactive Programming** (Frontend): Real-time UI updates with `BehaviorSubject` from RxJS

- When a task is being edited in one tab, other clients will be locked out from editing or deleting that task.
